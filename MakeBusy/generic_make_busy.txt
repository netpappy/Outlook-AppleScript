(* The goal of this script is to make an event to mark your calendar busy for the next day.
It will create the event, and all you have to do is save and close. That allows you to block your 
calendar for another day if desired. I just named mine "make busy", so I can press CMD-SPACE and 
type make busy to invoke this script.*)

(* Update the <EXHANGE-EMAIL-ADDRESS> to just be your Exchange Email Address*)
