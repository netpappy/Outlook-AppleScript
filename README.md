# Outlook-AppleScript
Here are my Outlook AppleScripts that I have written to make my interactions with Outlook easier. I did use some examples found by searching the internet, but it has been awhile, so I don't remember the webpages/blogs that I found that information on.

Make Busy - mark your calendar busy for tomorrow.

Meeting Maker - create a meeting invite pre-populated with your WebEx (or other meeting information) pre-populated.

OmniFocus Time Block - create a 1 hour time block with the details of the current task highlighted in OmniFocus.

FYI - AppleScript is not supported in "New" Outlook, however, it is scheduled for roll-out soon. Here is the link to the Microsoft Roadmap Item - I will be testing these scripts with the "New" Outlook once the functionality is released.
